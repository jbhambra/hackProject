Tech together hackathon project

##Inspiration:
Studies says that women are more likely than men to experience symptoms of stress and, women who are stressed are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. Music can help reduce the stress. HappyTogether makes women feel happy by playing their favorite and popular music.

##How does it work?
HappyTogether is a Chatbot that helps you feel happy and relaxed after a hard day. It measures heart rate and asks “how are you feeling today?”. Based on your answer, it will recommend music using Machine Learning Algorithm to cheer up your mood. It will measure the heart rate again and if it’s not within normal range,  then recommend some more music.

##How we built it?
We build it using React as front end  and Python/Flask for backend server.

##Accomplishments that we are proud of:
We’re proud of building clean and working user interface using React and Flask framework. We all had a big learning curve regarding React and Python. Neither knew much of anything about these technologies beforehand. 

##Challenges we ran into
There were a lot of challenges we ran into:
1) Understanding React code
2) Debugging ChatBot React component
3) Running Python locally
4) Understanding what python code was doing
5) Using Jupyter notebook to test Machine Learning sample codes
6) Creating a rest service with Python

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We loved meeting each other and working together. Our passion for coding was strengthened via out shared goal. We supported each other, learned new practices and code together and were able to overcome many challenges together. In the end, we were able to create a ChatBot and have it show YourTube Videos to the App user.

##What we learned
We learned that together we could overcome many challenges. We learned how all of us from diverse backgrounds brought so much knowledge, positivity and passion to the team.

##What's next for Happy Together
We plan to continue working on it together and keep it updated.
